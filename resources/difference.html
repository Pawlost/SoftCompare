 <p> JBoss EAP provides two operating modes for JBoss EAP instances: standalone server or managed domain. The standalone server operating mode represents running JBoss EAP as a single server instance. The managed domain operating mode allows for the management of multiple JBoss EAP instances from a single control point. </p> 
 <p> In addition, JBoss EAP includes APIs and development frameworks for quickly developing secure and scalable Java EE applications. </p>
