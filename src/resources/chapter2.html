   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <p> Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 (JBoss EAP) is a middleware platform built on open standards and compliant with the Java Enterprise Edition 7 specification. </p>
 <p> JBoss EAP includes a modular structure that allows service enabling only when required, improving startup speed. </p>
 <p> The management console and management command-line interface (CLI) make editing XML configuration files unnecessary and add the ability to script and automate tasks. </p>
 <p> In addition, JBoss EAP includes APIs and development frameworks for quickly developing secure and scalable Java EE applications. </p>
